<h5>Hi {{$name}},</h5>

<p>Thank you for joining our Fika Places community and for registering as an Event Organiser.</p>

<p>As an Event Organiser you are able to create events for Free. These events will appear on our website (www.fikaplaces.com) and on our Fika Places App. Your clients will have the option of buying tickets from our website or directly from our App, providing you with two distribution channels. If your event is free, then it will be displayed for all to see on our website.</p>

<p>For events that require tickets we also provide you with a FREE ticket scanning App, which will enable you to quickly scan tickets and keep account of all event data.</p>

<p>Download Fika Ticket Scanner here (......)</p>
<p>To open the Fika Ticket Scanner use the same login credentials as your Event Organiser profile.</p>
